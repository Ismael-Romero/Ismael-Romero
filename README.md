### ¡Hi stranger! 👋
I'm Ismael Romero, a software developer looking to change the world 🌍.

I'm currently working on a personal project, -Cupcake- a suite of tools that globally includes ERP and POS systems (for now). Also, I am refactoring some other small projects to publish them later.

###  I’m currently learning
* Golang
* Docker
* Electron JS
* React JS
